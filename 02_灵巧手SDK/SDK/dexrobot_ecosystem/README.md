# DexRobot Python SDK

A comprehensive software development kit for robotic hand control, simulation, and manipulation. This project provides a complete stack for working with dexterous robotic hands, from low-level hardware control to high-level simulation and planning.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Git LFS installed:

```bash
sudo apt install git-lfs      # For Ubuntu, for example
git lfs install
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://gitee.com/DexRobot/dexrobot_python_sdk.git
```

Make sure you have the `--recursive` flag turned on, so that all the submodules can be loaded. Alternatively, you can clone the submodules you need individually.
